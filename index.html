            <p>At work, I'm an engineer with a heavy focus on machine learning and data. </p>
            <p>Outside of work, I love to walk, bike, listen to music, and read.</p>

        <div>
          <p>I'm a machine learning engineer with experience building end-to-end ML systems. I acquired my Bachelor's in CS from the University of Maryland, College Park  and my Master's in CS with a specialization in ML from Georgia Tech. My <a target="_blank" href="resume.pdf">resume</a> gives a more comprehensive view of my work experience.</p>
          <p>I love to hike. On April 1, 2022, I ditched my belongings at my parents' house and set out to hike the Appalachian Trail. I successfully completed the trail in 117 days, and it was one of the most fulfilling experiences of my entire life. I chronicled every day of the sometimes mundane, sometimes thrilling journey on an Instagram photo diary: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/walkin_bill/">@walkin_bill</a>.</p>
          <p>When I'm not coding or hiking, you might find me messing with instruments, reading, playing video games, or taking photos. Musically, I play guitar and am going down the rabbit hole of audio synthesis/audio production. As for books, I'm a huge fan of fiction/literature. Some of my favorite authors are Kafka, Borges, and Salinger. For video games, I love the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls" target="_blank">Souls series</a> games, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slay_the_Spire" target="_blank"> Slay the Spire</a>, and other roguelikes.</p>
          <p>I'm vegan and think that nearly everyone should be vegan. People have argued <a  target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_(book)#Summary">more soundly than me</a> why others should be vegan. I typically don't preach my views on veganism unless explicitly asked, because I don't believe verbal debate is a very effective way to change people's minds.</p>

        <p>I have some thoughts, but sometimes when I think back on them, they're not quite as profound as I thought they were. I'm reserving this space for thoughts that I have, but not committing to keeping them on here forever :)</p>

          Having a blog feels slightly unnatural, because it's kind of a one-sided conversation where you put your thoughts out there without much dialogue or criticism. I certainly don't proclaim any of what I write as hard fact, 
          and if you wish to discuss any innacuracies or additional resources to supplement my posts, please contact me at <a href="mailto:will@willbeckman.com">will@willbeckman.com</a>.

                    One thing I think about fairly often is how people come up with new ideas. I think this applies equally
                     to creative and technical pursuits. Ideation is some concoction of accumulated expertise and exposure
                     to new ideas that's set to marinate for a while.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gaining expertise is a very personal pursuit, but in my limited experience, a great way to do it
                    is just to work in a field or to immerse yourself in something for a long time. There's
                    no substitute for crystallized knowledge and seeing complicated things in many different ways.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In terms of being introduced to new ideas, a great way to do this actively is to have discussions
                    with other people. Having discussions with other people is great because they think about things
                    differently, have different experiences, and can tailor their explanations of unfamiliar concepts
                    to your level of familiarity. A great way to do this passively is through through reading. Reading
                    can often be more curated, since the author can take more time to phrase things in a thoughtful way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My preferred mode of letting thoughts marinate is to go on long walks. Sometimes I'm distracted
                    when I walk, but I find that even given this distraction, my mind tends to work more creatively.
                    Some of the best conversations that I've had with friends are on long walks.

              Agent programmed for the OpenAI Gym Lunar Lander environment. The final agent used a neural network
              policy with experience replay. Neural network was not a CNN from raw pixels, but a feedforward NN trained
              on sensor "measurements" from the agent provided from the environment. This was one of my favorite
              assignments from Georgia Tech. If you're interested in the technical details of the project, the
              report accompanying the project can be found <a href="lunar-lander-analysis.pdf">here</a>

              I largely did not do the work for this project, but improving it for my purposes required some knowledge about how 
              the system works and what knobs to tweak to adapt it to my use case. I pulled a <a href="https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning">repo</a> that implements
              <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04558.pdf">this paper</a>. In this setup, there are three models: a speaker embedding model,
              a text-to-speech model conditioned on a speaker embedding, and a vocoder.
