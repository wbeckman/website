I'm a machine learning engineer with experience building end-to-end ML systems. I have a Bachelor's in CS from the University of Maryland, College Park and a Master's in CS with a specialization in ML from Georgia Tech. My [resume](/assets/resume.pdf) gives a more comprehensive view of my work experience.

I love to hike! On April 1, 2022, I left New York City to set out and hike the Appalachian Trail. I successfully completed the trail in 117 days, and it was one of the most fulfilling experiences of my entire life. I chronicled every day of the sometimes mundane, sometimes incredible journey on an Instagram photo diary: [@walkin_bill](https://www.instagram.com/walkin_bill/). I moved back to NYC, where I currently reside, in January 2023.

When I'm not coding or hiking, you'll find me messing with instruments, reading, playing video games, or taking photos. Musically, I play guitar and am going down the rabbit hole of audio synthesis with modular synths. As for books, I'm a huge fan of fiction/literature, and as for for video games, I love the Souls series games and roguelikes.

I'm also vegan. I don't typically preach my views on veganism unless explicitly asked, but it's a part of my identity worth mentioning.
