I'm a machine learning engineer with experience building end-to-end ML systems. I acquired my Bachelor's in CS from the University of Maryland, College Park and my Master's in CS with a specialization in ML from Georgia Tech. My resume gives a more comprehensive view of my work experience.

I love to hike. On April 1, 2022, I ditched my belongings at my parents' house and set out to hike the Appalachian Trail. I successfully completed the trail in 117 days, and it was one of the most fulfilling experiences of my entire life. I chronicled every day of the sometimes mundane, sometimes thrilling journey on an Instagram photo diary: @walkin_bill.

When I'm not coding or hiking, you might find me messing with instruments, reading, playing video games, or taking photos. Musically, I play guitar and am going down the rabbit hole of audio synthesis/audio production. As for books, I'm a huge fan of fiction/literature. Some of my favorite authors are Kafka, Borges, and Salinger. For video games, I love the Souls series games, Slay the Spire, and other roguelikes.

I'm vegan and think that nearly everyone should be vegan. People have argued more soundly than me why others should be vegan. I typically don't preach my views on veganism unless explicitly asked, because I don't believe verbal debate is a very effective way to change people's minds.
